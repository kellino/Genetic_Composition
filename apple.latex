\title{The Apple Never Falls Far From The Tree}
\author{David Kelly}

\maketitle

The apple is a fascinating plant. There are presently over 7,500 \textit{cultivars} of apple
known\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple}}. The genome is  incredibly complex, with
approximately 57,000 genes, almost double that of humans. If one were to plant a apple from a Granny
Smith tree, the resulting tree and fruit would be unique. All Granny Smith's are grown from cuttings
from the original tree. This composition tries to reflect some of these characteristics.

The English folk song \textbf{I will give my love an apple}\footnote{\url{http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ill-give-my-love-an-apple-emc/}}, 
dating from 15th century\footnote{here in a performance by Andreas Scholl} is used as the basis of a piece of music concr√©te which
progressively transforms the source material through a series of mutations, much in the manner that
the apple genome itself morphs from generation to generation\footnote{Lines from Hardy's poem
    'Heredity' come to mind: I am the family face;/ Flesh perishes, I live on,/ Projecting trait
    and trace/ Through time to times anon, And leaping from place to place/
Over oblivion.}. Some generations are similar to
their parents, some are far removed.

The composition loosely follows sonata form. There is an initial exposition of the material - an
extract from the source recording - which is then sliced into sections. Imagine these sections to be
representitive of genetic strands, mobile and malleable.
