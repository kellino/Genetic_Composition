Simple algorithmic composition for Computer Music UCl
===========

Requirements:
    * Python3.5
    * numpy
    * pydub (available on pip)

While the program is written in python3.5, it should be relatively easy to convert to python2.7
A presentation is also available for the ipython / jupyter notebook. It can be viewed on 
the [github](https://github.com/kellino/Genetic_Composition) for this project.

The sample, for which I am not the copyright holder, is taken from a performance by Andreas Scholl of the
traditional English Ballad 'I will give my love an apple'
